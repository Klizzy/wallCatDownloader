# WallCat Downloader

![](https://github.com/Klizzy/wallCatDownloader/workflows/Build/badge.svg)


This script downloads the picture of the day from [Wallcat](https://beta.wall.cat).
Messages are send as native OS (MacOS, Ubuntu or Windows) notifications.

The image will be saved into the current directory. Alternatively you can specify the target directory in `const targetPath = ""`

# Setup
run `go build main.go` to create the executable for your OS

## Misc
I made this project to learn go, so it might not follow general conventions. Improvement suggestions are always appreciated!
